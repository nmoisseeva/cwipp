CWIPP model documentation
====================================

Cross-Wind Integrated Plume Penetration (CWIPP) model is an analytical method for predicting the vertical distribution of smoke in the atmosphere above a wildfire.

This collection of diagnostic routines can be applied as a stand-alone model for real-world plumes, as well as used with numerical output from WRF-SFIRE LES simulations.

Scientific background and details of model development can be found in:
https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-827/

This documentation page is designed to aid implementation of CWIPP within BlueSky Canada smoke modelling framework with the goal of improving operational forecasts produced for:
