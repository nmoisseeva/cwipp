==========================

Cross-Wind Integrated Plume Penetration (CWIPP) model is an analytical method for predicting the vertical distribution of smoke in the atmosphere above a wildfire.

This collection of diagnostic routines can be applied as a stand-alone model for real-world plumes, as well as used with numerical output from WRF-SFIRE LES simulations.

Scientific background and details of model development can be found in: https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-827/
